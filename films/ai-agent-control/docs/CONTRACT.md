# Build contract

The one source of truth for how the film's code fits together.
Every agent that touches this project follows it.

## Goal

A 60-second vertical motion film «Кто контролирует работу AI-агента?» for Instagram Stories: it leads a developer to the free lesson «От AI-кодинга к AI Engineering» (recording + source code). Drawn entirely by JavaScript on a canvas, with music and sound effects synthesised in JavaScript; the author's voice-over is recorded separately and laid on top in the edit, so the film carries burned-in captions (and a clean variant without them).
It ships as one self-contained HTML file and as rendered MP4s (with captions, clean).
The look and editing follow `docs/art-bible.md`.

## Hard rules

1. **No media.** The shipped HTML contains no images, video, audio files, fonts files, base64, `data:` URLs, `<img>`, `new Image`, `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, or CSS `url(...)`. Every pixel and every sample is computed.
2. **Deterministic.** `FILM.renderFrame(T)` draws the same pixels every time for the same `T`, in any order. No `Math.random`, no `Date`, no `performance.now` inside drawing or audio code. Randomness comes from `FILM.lib.rng(seed)`.
3. **Stateless per frame.** A scene's `draw` may not depend on a previous frame having been drawn. Caches are allowed only if they are pure functions of their inputs (for example a pre-rendered paper texture keyed by size and seed).
4. **Canvas** is 1080 wide by 1920 tall. Output is 24 fps.
5. **Plain browser JavaScript**, no build framework, no npm packages in the shipped file. Node is used only for tools.
6. **File ownership.** A scene agent edits only its own `src/scenes/<file>.js`. Shared files (`src/core.js`, `src/lib.js`, `src/timeline.js`, `src/player.js`, `tools/*`) are edited only by the agent assigned to them. If a scene needs a helper that `lib` lacks, it defines the helper inside its own file.

## Files

| Path | Owner | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `src/core.js` | foundation (director) | Defines `window.FILM`, the scene registry, `renderFrame`, global post-processing (neutral grain) and the burned-in captions layer from `FILM.TIMELINE.captions` (`?captions=0` turns it off). |
| `src/lib.js` | foundation (director) | `FILM.lib`: RNG, noise, easing, palette, and the film's UI kit `FILM.lib.ui` + shared geometry `FILM.lib.GEO` (art bible §11). |
| `src/timeline.js` | storyboard | `FILM.TIMELINE`: bpm, duration, shot list with ids, files, times, modes and briefs, and the audio cue list. |
| `src/scenes/NN-<id>.js` | one scene agent each | Registers one shot with `FILM.scene({...})`. `NN` is the two-digit shot order. |
| `src/music.js` | music agent | `FILM.audio.render(ctx, opts)`: schedules the whole score and effects into any `BaseAudioContext`. |
| `src/player.js` | foundation | Interactive player page behaviour. |
| `tools/snap.cjs` | foundation | Renders PNG stills and contact sheets headlessly for review. |
| `tools/stubgen.cjs` | foundation | Generates one placeholder scene per timeline shot (the stub pass). |
| `tools/build.cjs` | foundation | Inlines everything into `dist/<slug>.html`. |
| `tools/render.cjs` | foundation | Renders the MP4 with audio into `exports/`. |
| `tools/check.cjs` | foundation | Automated checks: no media, determinism, full timeline coverage, every scene draws without throwing, frame cost. |
| `docs/storyboard.md`, `docs/art-bible.md` | storyboard | The human-readable plan and the visual rules for this film. |

Load order everywhere: `core.js`, `lib.js`, `timeline.js`, scene files sorted by filename, `music.js`, `player.js`.

## API

### Scene registration

```js
FILM.scene({
  id: 'egg-blueprint',          // must match a shot id in FILM.TIMELINE.shots
  draw(ctx, t, info) {
    // t: seconds since this shot started (0 .. info.dur)
    // info: { dur, p /* t/dur, 0..1 */, T /* global seconds */, frame /* global frame index */, W, H, lib, shot /* the timeline entry */ }
  },
});
```

Start and end times come from `FILM.TIMELINE`, never from the scene file, so re-timing is a one-file change.
`core` wraps each `draw` in `ctx.save()` / `ctx.restore()` and resets the transform, alpha, composite mode and filters first.
A shot may declare `transitionIn: { dur, kind }` in the timeline; `core` handles supported kinds (`cut` default, `fade`, `flash`, `iris`, `wipe`) by drawing both shots into offscreen layers.

### Core

- `FILM.W`, `FILM.H`, `FILM.FPS`, `FILM.DURATION` (from the timeline).
- `FILM.renderFrame(T)` draws global time `T` to `FILM.canvas`.
- `FILM.mount(canvas)` sets the target canvas.
- `FILM.activeShot(T)` returns the timeline entry.
- Global post: paper grain over illustrated shots, fine noise over schematic shots, both re-seeded on a 12 fps "boil" clock so the texture shimmers like drawn animation.

### Lib (minimum surface)

- `rng(seed)` returns a function producing [0,1). `hash(...values)` returns a stable 32-bit int.
- `noise1(x, seed)`, `noise2(x, y, seed)` smooth value noise in [-1,1].
- `clamp`, `lerp`, `invLerp`, `smoothstep`, `ease` (`inOutCubic`, `outBack`, `outExpo`, `inOutSine`, and so on), `mapRange`.
- `boil(T, fps = 12)` returns the held drawing-frame index for line wobble.
- `onTwos(t)` quantises time to 1/12 s for character motion.
- `inkPath(ctx, points, opts)`: a hand-drawn polyline or closed shape with seeded wobble, pressure-varying width, optional double stroke.
- `hatch(ctx, clipFn, opts)`: parallel strokes at an angle and spacing, clipped by a path function, each stroke slightly jittered. `crossHatch` layers two.
- `stipple(ctx, clipFn, opts)`: seeded dot fill with density control.
- `paper(ctx, opts)`: cream paper base with grain and fibres, cached.
- `blueprint(ctx, opts)`: navy base, faint grid, guide circles and diagonals.
- `hexLattice(ctx, clipFn, opts)`, `glowDot(ctx, x, y, r, opts)`, `ticks(ctx, ...)`, `bracket(ctx, ...)`, `guideCircle(ctx, ...)`, `arcAnnotation(ctx, ...)`.
- `stripes(ctx, opts)`: the wide diagonal stripe background.
- `camera(ctx, { x, y, zoom, rot }, fn)`: draws `fn` under a camera transform centred on the frame.
- `pal`: named colours from the art bible.
- `text(ctx, str, x, y, opts)`: a thin single-line wordmark drawn with system sans-serif (no font files).

### Audio

```js
FILM.audio = {
  render(ctx, { start = 0, dest = ctx.destination } = {}) { /* schedule every note and effect from global time `start` */ }
};
```

Everything is synthesised from oscillators, filtered seeded noise buffers, envelopes, delays and a convolver built from generated impulse responses.
The score is written against `FILM.TIMELINE.bpm` and `FILM.TIMELINE.cues` so hits land on the cuts.
The same function feeds the live player (`AudioContext`) and the MP4 render (`OfflineAudioContext`, 48 kHz stereo).

### Tools

```bash
node tools/snap.cjs --times 1.0,2.5 --out .frames/check            # stills at global times (with --shot, times count from the shot's start)
node tools/snap.cjs --shot <id> --samples 6 --sheet                # frames spread over one shot plus a contact sheet
node tools/snap.cjs --samples 24 --sheet --scale 0.25              # the whole film on one labelled sheet
node tools/snap.cjs --shot <id> --only                             # load only core, lib, timeline and this shot's file
node tools/stubgen.cjs                                             # placeholder scene per shot (run before scene work starts)
node tools/build.cjs                                               # writes dist/<slug>.html
node tools/check.cjs                                               # all automated checks, exits non-zero on failure
node tools/render.cjs [--from 0 --to 30] [--scale 0.5] [--out exports/name.mp4] [--clean]   # --clean: no captions
node tools/snap.cjs ... [--clean]                                   # stills without captions
```

`snap.cjs` writes a unique temporary HTML page per run under `.tmp/`, so several agents can render at the same time without clashing.
`--only` exists so a shot can be rendered while a sibling shot file is half-written.
Images go under `.frames/` (git-ignored). Look at them — reading the pixels is the review.

## Shell note for agents

Prefer absolute paths in shell commands; some agent harnesses block `cd <folder> && ...` chains.
Playwright installs into `tools/node_modules` (`npm install` there right after copying the foundation).
